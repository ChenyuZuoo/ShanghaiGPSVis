#Cartography LBS Project
Data is not avalable for public, it's taxi gps in Shanghai, in April 2010.
Firstly, we need to load valid data into MySQL database.
Secondly, data cleaning.
Then data visualization.
And the final stage is pattern analysis.


loadwhole.py is used for import data in bulk.

readline.py is simply used for print lines in big files.

filter.py is used for out put compute average position of one point.
